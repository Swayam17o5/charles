Telnet (TELecommunication NETwork) is a network protocol that allows a user to log in and control a remote computer through a command-line interface over a TCP/IP network.

Port Number: 23 (TCP)

Working:
The Telnet client connects to a Telnet server using port 23.
After login, a virtual terminal session is created — commands typed on the client are executed on the server.

Uses:

Remote login and administration

Network testing and troubleshooting

Configuring routers and switches

Advantages:

Simple and easy to use

Good for testing network connectivity

Disadvantages:

No encryption (data sent in plain text)

Insecure — replaced by SSH

Difference (Telnet vs SSH):
Telnet → Unsecure, Port 23
SSH → Secure, Port 22
